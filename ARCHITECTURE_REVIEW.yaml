    title: "Add model startup health checks"
    status: "[x]"  # completed
    severity: HIGH
    effort: MEDIUM
    description: |
      Models are marked "running" immediately after docker run, before they're
      actually ready to serve requests. Need to poll /health endpoint.
    current_behavior: |
      - model-manager/server.py starts container with docker run -d
      - Returns "running" status immediately
      - Model may take 30s-5min to actually load
    expected_behavior: |
      - Start container
      - Poll /health or /v1/models endpoint
      - Only return "running" when health check passes
      - Return "starting" with progress indication during load
    files_to_modify:
      - model-manager/server.py  # start_model(), get_model_status()

      Implementation complete (2026-01-14):
      Backend:
      - Background health check loop polls /health, /v1/models, /api/tags
      - 'starting' status with startup_progress tracking
      - /api/models/{id}/health endpoint returns health + progress
      - Timeout: 600s default, 900s for 100B+ models
      Frontend:
      - Progress bar with animated glow effect
      - Shows elapsed time / timeout (e.g., "1:30 / 10:00")
      - Shows health check count
      - Cancel button to abort startup
      - Pulsing border animation for starting cards

    title: "Consolidate configs into single source"
    status: "[x]"  # completed
    severity: HIGH
    effort: HIGH
    description: |
      Configuration is split between models.json, serve.sh scripts, and
      docker-compose files. This causes drift and maintenance burden.
    current_behavior: |
      - models.json: port, container_name, basic settings
      - vllm-*/serve.sh: actual runtime config (context, memory, flags)
      - docker-compose: environment variables, volumes
      - Values often don't match between sources
    expected_behavior: |
      - Single models.yaml with complete config per model
      - serve.sh scripts auto-generated or read from config
      - docker-compose uses config values via env substitution
    files_to_modify:
      - models.json → models.yaml (migrate)
      - model-manager/server.py (read new format)
      - vllm-*/serve.sh (generate or template)

    notes: |
      Implementation complete (2026-01-14):
      - Created models.yaml with unified schema (schema_version: 1.0)
      - Supports defaults section for common vLLM/Ollama settings
      - Per-model settings override defaults
      - Added pyyaml to requirements.txt
      - Updated server.py with normalize_yaml_config(), validate_config()
      - Config caching with mtime-based invalidation
      - Validation checks: required fields, ports, engines, script dirs
      - API returns description and estimated_memory_gb from YAML
      - Maintains backward compatibility with models.json fallback
      - serve.sh scripts kept for complex/distributed models (engine: script)

    severity: HIGH
    effort: MEDIUM
    description: |
      All APIs currently have no authentication. Any local network client
      can start/stop models, execute code, search web.
    current_behavior: |
      - CORS allows all origins (allow_origins=["*"])
      - No API keys or tokens required
      - No rate limiting
    expected_behavior: |
      - Optional API key authentication (env var to enable)
      - Rate limiting per client IP
      - Audit logging of all API calls

    severity: MEDIUM
    effort: LOW
    description: |
      Ports and URLs are hardcoded throughout the codebase, making deployment
      to different environments difficult.
    current_behavior: |
      - web-gui/src/api.ts: SANDBOX_API_PORT = 5176
      - web-gui/src/api.ts: MODEL_MANAGER_API port 5175
      - AVAILABLE_MODELS has hardcoded ports per model
      - docker-compose: SEARXNG_URL hardcoded IP
    expected_behavior: |
      - All ports/URLs from environment variables
      - Defaults for development, overridable for production
      - Single config file for all service URLs
    files_to_modify:
      - web-gui/src/api.ts

    title: "Implement GPU memory allocation tracking"
    status: "[x]"  # completed
    severity: MEDIUM
    effort: MEDIUM
    description: |
      No tracking of GPU memory usage when starting models. Users can
      accidentally start multiple large models causing OOM.
    current_behavior: |
      - Models started with --gpus all
      - No check if enough VRAM available
      - OOM discovered only after startup fails
    expected_behavior: |
      - Track estimated VRAM per model in config
      - Query nvidia-smi for current usage before start
      - Warn or block if insufficient memory
      - Show memory usage in dashboard
    files_to_modify:
      - models.json/yaml (add estimated_memory field)
      - model-manager/server.py (add memory check)
      - web-gui (show memory warning)

        status: "[-]"  # Skipped - blocking with force option is sufficient
    notes: |
      Implementation complete (2026-01-14):
      - Added estimated_memory_gb to all models in models.yaml
      - Created get_unified_memory_info() for DGX Spark unified memory
      - Added check_memory_for_model() with thresholds (2GB block, 5GB warn)
      - Pre-start memory check blocks with 409 Conflict if insufficient
      - Added force=true query param to bypass memory check
      - Updated /api/system/memory to return unified memory info
      - Added /api/models/{id}/memory-check endpoint
      - Dashboard shows estimated memory per model card
      - Dashboard prompts to force start if memory insufficient
      - Works for unified memory systems (DGX Spark, Jetson)

    status: "[x]"  # completed
    severity: MEDIUM
    effort: HIGH
    description: |
      Model-manager runs in Docker but controls host Docker daemon via
      mounted socket. This is a security risk and reliability concern.
    current_behavior: |
      - model-manager container mounts /var/run/docker.sock
      - Can spawn unlimited containers on host
      - No resource limits enforced
      - Container crash affects host Docker
    expected_behavior: |
      Option A: Run model-manager on host (not in Docker)
      Option B: Use Docker API over TCP with TLS
      Option C: Use container orchestrator (k8s, docker swarm)
    files_to_modify:
      - model-manager/Dockerfile
      - web-gui/docker-compose.yml
      - model-manager/server.py (if using Docker API)

    notes: |
      Implementation complete (2026-01-14):
      Chose Option A - Run model-manager on host (simplest for single-node):
      - Created serve-host.sh for running on host with venv
      - Created model-manager.service systemd unit file
      - Uses Python virtual environment in model-manager/venv
      - Resource limits added to spawned containers:
        --memory (1.2x estimated_memory_gb)
        --memory-swap (memory + 16g)
        --shm-size 16g
      - systemd service has MemoryMax=512M, CPUQuota=50%
      - No more docker socket mounting needed

    title: "Add structured logging and tracing"
    status: "[x]"  # completed
    severity: MEDIUM
    effort: MEDIUM
    description: |
      Logs are unstructured stdout/docker logs. No request tracing
      across services. Hard to debug issues.
    current_behavior: |
      - print() statements and basic logging
      - No request IDs
      - No correlation between services
      - Logs lost on container restart
    expected_behavior: |
      - Structured JSON logging
      - Request ID propagated through all services
      - Log aggregation (optional: ELK, Loki)
      - OpenTelemetry tracing (optional)
    files_to_modify:
      - model-manager/server.py
      - tool-call-sandbox/server.py
      - web-gui/metrics-api.py

        status: "[-]"  # Deferred - structured logging sufficient for now
    notes: |
      Implementation complete (2026-01-14):
      - Added structlog>=24.0.0 to requirements.txt
      - Configured structlog with JSON output for model-manager
      - Created RequestLoggingMiddleware for X-Request-ID handling:
        - Accepts incoming X-Request-ID header or generates new UUID
        - Binds request context (method, path, request_id)
        - Logs duration_ms, status_code on completion
        - Returns X-Request-ID in response header
      - Replaced all print() statements with structured log calls
      - Each log entry includes: timestamp (ISO), level, request_id, event
      - OpenTelemetry deferred - current logging sufficient for debugging

      Tool sandbox executes arbitrary code with only Docker isolation.
      No seccomp profiles, minimal base image, or code analysis.
    current_behavior: |
      - Sandbox container runs arbitrary Python/Bash
      - Basic resource limits (256MB RAM, 0.5 CPU)
      - No network by default
      - No syscall filtering
    expected_behavior: |

    severity: MEDIUM
    effort: LOW
    description: |
      Token estimation uses chars/1.8 which is inaccurate. Causes
      context overflow errors or overly aggressive compression.
    current_behavior: |
      - estimateTokens() uses text.length / 1.8
      - Off by up to 40% in some cases
      - Causes 400 errors from vLLM
    expected_behavior: |
      - Use proper tokenizer (tiktoken or model-specific)
      - Pre-validate context before sending
      - Show token count in UI
    files_to_modify:
      - web-gui/src/api.ts

    notes: |
      Implementation complete (2026-01-14):
      - Added gpt-tokenizer package (GPT-4 BPE tokenizer)
      - Updated estimateTokens() to use encode() function
      - Fallback to chars/3.5 if tokenizer fails
      - Added getContextInfo() method to ChatAPI class
      - Token counter display in Chat UI shows:
        - Current tokens / max context tokens
        - Percentage used
        - Warning state (orange) at 70% usage
        - Critical state (red pulse) at 90% usage
      - CSS styling with animated pulse for critical state
      - Bundle size increased ~1.2MB due to tokenizer vocab
